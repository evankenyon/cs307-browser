This project implements a web view.

Name: Evan Kenyon

### Timeline

Start Date: 9-18-21

Finish Date: 9-20-21

Hours Spent: 10


### Tutorial and other Resources Used
Besides the resources attributed in inline comments, I used the JavaFX documentation and geeksforgeeks site.
Also, this project was based on the starter code originally given in the lab_browser course Gitlab repo, which
had one big class that contained the view and model components. I simply separated the components, disabled buttons
when appropriate, and added the home feature, the favorites feature, and the top sites feature.


### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: none

Key/Mouse inputs: Use mouse to select things, click buttons, and click on URL display box. Use keyboard
to type in a URL or favorite reference.

Known Bugs: none


### Impressions
This was a useful assignment for learning how to separate view and model classes. However, I did not end up
understanding how to create inheritance hierarchies, and I think it would've been helpful to have seen something
like that before (maybe in the Maze project for example). I did miss lab though, since I was waiting on a covid 
test, so there is a chance that I would have had better luck in that regard if I could have gone.
